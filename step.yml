title: Xcode Test for iOS
summary: |-
  Runs your project's pre-defined Xcode tests on every build.
description: |-
  This Steps runs all those Xcode tests that are included in your project. 
  The Step will work out of the box if your project has test targets and your Workflow has the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step which exports the test results and (code coverage files if needed) to the Test Reports page. 
  This Step does not need any code signing files since the Step deploys only the test results to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

  ### Configuring the Step
  If you click into the Step, there are some required input fields whose input must be set in accordance with the Xcode configuration of the project.  
  The **Scheme name** input field must be marked as Shared in Xcode. 
  The **Device**, **OS version**, **Platform** input fields must be set to the value that's shown in Xcode’s device selection dropdown menu.
  If you wish to export code coverage files as well, set the "Generate code coverage files?" to `yes`.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step is missing from your Workflow, then the **Xcode Test for iOS** Step will not be able to export the test results on the Test Reports page and you won't be able to view them either.
  The xcpretty output tool does not support parallel tests. 
  If parallel tests are enabled in your project, go to the Step’s Debug section and set the **Output tool** input’s value to xcodebuild.
  If the Xcode test fails with the error `Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier`, then check our [system reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports) to see if the requested simulator is on the stack or not. 
  If it is not, then pick a simulator that is on the stack.

        Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

        Indexing is needed for

        * Autocomplete
        * Ability to quickly jump to definition
        * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

        Which are not needed in CI environment.

        **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
        In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.

        Options added to the end of the `xcodebuild build test` call.

        If you leave empty this input, xcodebuild will be called as:

        `xcodebuild

          -scheme SCHEME
          build test
          -destination platform=PLATFORM Simulator,name=NAME,OS=VERSION`

        In case of `generate_code_coverage_files: "yes"`
        `xcodebuild` gets two additional flags:

        * GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES
        * GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES

        If you want to add more options, list that separated by space character.
        Example: `-xcconfig PATH -verbose`

    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "Run xcodebuild test only"
      description: |-
        If `single_build` is set to false, the step runs `xcodebuild OPTIONS build OPTIONS` before the test
        to generate the project derived data. After that comes `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`. This command's log is presented in the step's log.

        If `single_build` is set to true, then the step calls only `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`.
      value_options:
      - "true"
      - "false"

      category: Debug

      description: |-
        Previous Xcode versions and configurations may throw the error `iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.`
        when the compilation before performing the tests takes too long.

        This is fixed by running `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS` instead of `xcodebuild OPTIONS test OPTIONS`.
        Calling an explicit build before the test results in the code being compiled twice, thus creating an overhead.

        Unless you are sure that your configuration is not prone to this error, it is recommended to leave this option turned on.
      value_options:
        - "yes"
        - "no"

      title: "Should retry test on failure?"
      description: |-
       If you set this input to `yes`, the Step will rerun your tests. With Xcode 13 and above, only your failed test cases will be rerun. With older Xcode versions, all test cases will be rerun.
        Please note that this feature is only available from Xcode 13 and above, earlier versions support rerunning ALL test cases instead of a specific failed one.
